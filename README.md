![Hi, I'm Angelo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78776381/138191879-91115ada-df41-4161-8678-68f04d626cdf.gif)

## About me

**Hello, I am 27 years old and I am passionate about classical music as well as rubbing shoulders for hours. One of the things I like the most about creating applications is how surprised I am when I see the final finish.**

**Programming came into my life when I found on Google that it is one of the most demanded jobs and this prompted me to give a better life to my family, then I discovered that this is another of my passions.**

**If you ask me about my work environment, I would tell you what it is to Listen to Tchaicovsky's Sixth Symphony and create one application at a time.**

**Another curious fact about me is that I love to travel the world, thank God I have managed to do it as a professional musician, that's why the banner.**

**I'm currently learning Typescript and React Native.**
